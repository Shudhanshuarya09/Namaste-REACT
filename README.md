## Question1 - What is Emmet?
# Answer-      Emmet allows developers to type abbreviations and then expand them into complete HTML or CSS code snippets. In the context of React, Emmet can be particularly useful for writing JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used in React applications to describe the structure of user interfaces.
