<h3> Question1 - What is Emmet?</h3>

   <h3> Answer- </h3>Emmet allows developers to type abbreviations and then expand them into complete HTML or CSS code snippets. In the context of React, Emmet can be particularly useful for writing JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used in React applications to describe the structure of user interfaces. 

<h3> Question2 - Difference between "LIBRARY" and "FRAMEWORK" ? </h3>

<h3> Answer- Library :- </h3>

- A library is a collection of reusable code modules or functions that can be directly called by an application to perform specific tasks.
- Libraries typically consist of a set of functions, classes, or routines organized in a way that developers can use them to extend the functionality of their own applications.

<h3> Framework :- </h3>

- A framework is a pre-built architecture or platform that provides a foundation for developing software applications.
- Frameworks typically include libraries, along with conventions, patterns, and guidelines for how to use them to build applications.
